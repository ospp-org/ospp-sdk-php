## [0.4.2] — 2026-05-10

Spec-alignment correctness release. Two value objects had drifted from the
canonical mqtt-envelope schema; both now enforce exactly the schema's
constraints (no more, no less). Surfaced via DLQ inspection of the csms-server
UAT environment, where every inbound message from non-PHP clients was being
rejected with `INVALID_MESSAGE_FORMAT (1005)` at SDK construction time.

### Fixed

- `MessageId` constructor no longer enforces `msg_`/`cmd_`/`err_` prefix
  whitelist. Spec defines `messageId` as `{type: string, minLength: 1,
  maxLength: 64}` with no pattern, and `spec/spec/03-messages.md:2957-2972`
  normatively states prefixes are a SHOULD convention that implementations
  MUST NOT rely on for routing. The previous whitelist was both over-strict
  and divergent from the spec's own prefix table (`boot_`/`hb_`/`evt_`/`sec_`/
  `tx_`/`auth_`/`cmd_`/`lwt-`): two of the three enforced prefixes don't
  appear in the recommendation. Spec-compliant raw-UUID inbound (e.g., from
  the TS station-simulator emitting via `crypto.randomUUID()`) was previously
  rejected at construction; now accepted.
- `ProtocolVersion::fromString` validates input against the schema regex
  `^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$` and enforces `maxLength: 32` before parsing. Previously
  silently coerced non-numeric components via `(int)` cast (`"abc.def.ghi"`
  became `0.0.0`; `"1.2.3-rc1"` became `1.2.3`). Now rejects with a clear
  format-error message at the boundary.

### Migration

None required for emit-side or correctly-formed inputs. If a consumer
deliberately fed `ProtocolVersion::fromString` a string that was being
silently coerced, it now throws — but such inputs were never spec-valid.

`MessageId::generate()` emit-side behavior unchanged — still produces
`msg_<uuid>` (or `cmd_<uuid>` for REQUEST messages built via `MessageBuilder`).
Existing prefixed values continue to construct successfully.

### Spec source-of-truth

- `spec/schemas/common/mqtt-envelope.schema.json` (`messageId`, `protocolVersion`)
- `spec/spec/03-messages.md:2957-2972` (prefix SHOULD-only language)

### Tests

- 668 tests, 4157 assertions, all green (was 661 in v0.4.1; +7 new boundary
  and spec-compliance tests).

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-09

Documentation correction. The v0.4.0 CHANGELOG framed `ProtocolVersion::default()` returning `'0.2.1'` as a "deferred cascade" that needed bumping to `'0.4.0'`. That framing was incorrect.

### Verified (no code changes)

Spec v0.4.0 wire `protocolVersion` field deliberately remains `'0.2.1'` (verified empirically via `spec/02-transport.md`, `schemas/common/mqtt-envelope.schema.json` regex `^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$`, `spec/08-configuration.md` `ProtocolVersion` config-key default, and 174+ JSON examples across `spec/profiles/`). Spec v0.4.0 introduced feature additions (Item 3 `seqNo`/`finalSeqNo`, Item 8 `reason` vocabulary, Item 4 canonical-form consolidation) but did NOT bump the wire version field; the v0.4.0 spec bump commit (`d2d6c0c`) modified only chapter status headers.

`ProtocolVersion::default()` returning `'0.2.1'` is therefore CORRECT — aligned with spec wire mandate, aligned with TS SDK (`@ospp/protocol@0.4.0` `OSPP_PROTOCOL_VERSION = '0.2.1'`), aligned with csms-server `VersionNegotiator` validation expectations.

SDK package version `0.4.0` reflects spec FEATURE TARGETING (matching v0.4.0 features added in this SDK release), NOT wire VERSION. Package version and wire version are independently scoped per spec convention; future spec minor cycles will revisit wire-version discrimination strategy (per spec CHANGELOG [0.4.0] migration note: "per-message envelope `protocolVersion` discrimination, BootNotification capability negotiation").

### Changed

- `CHANGELOG.md` [0.4.0] section "Known mismatch (deferred)" subsection removed; framing was misleading.
- `src/ValueObjects/ProtocolVersion.php` — doc-comment on `default()` clarifies that the returned value is the spec-mandated wire version, NOT the SDK package version.

### Migration

None. No code changes; `ProtocolVersion::default()` still returns `'0.2.1'` (now correctly framed as spec-aligned, not deferred).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-09

Aligns SDK with OSPP spec v0.4.0. Includes catch-up backport of the v0.2.5 provisioning schema and v0.3.0 `stationCaChain`/`brokerRootCa` additions that the v0.3.x SDK line skipped, plus the v0.4.0 Item 3 (`seqNo` / `finalSeqNo`) and Item 8 (`SessionEndReason` vocabulary) wire deltas. **Coordinated v0.3.x → v0.4.0 station/server upgrade required** — see Migration.

### Added
- `schemas/provisioning-response.schema.json` — HTTP `POST /api/v1/stations/provision` response schema (spec v0.2.5 backport; ships at v0.3.0 + v0.4.0 state with `stationCaChain`, optional `brokerRootCa`, and 12-field `mqttConfig` including `brokerHost`/`brokerPort`/`brokerUri`). Top-level placement, not under `ble/`/`common/`/`mqtt/` (mirrors spec layout — provisioning is HTTP-bound). Defaults align with spec `02-transport.md §1.2` normative connection parameters.
- `schemas/mqtt/meter-values-event.schema.json` — optional `seqNo` (integer ≥ 0); per-session monotonic counter starting at 0 (spec v0.4.0 Item 3).
- `schemas/mqtt/session-ended-event.schema.json` — optional `seqNo` + optional `finalSeqNo` (integer ≥ 0); `reason` enum extended to 5 values (spec v0.4.0 Items 3 + 8).
- `schemas/mqtt/stop-service-response.schema.json` — optional `finalSeqNo` (integer ≥ 0); existing Accepted/Rejected `allOf` conditional unaffected (spec v0.4.0 Item 3).
- `Ospp\Protocol\Enums\SessionEndReason` — three new cases: `LOCAL` (`'Local'`), `LOCAL_OUT_OF_CREDIT` (`'LocalOutOfCredit'`), `DEAUTHORIZED` (`'Deauthorized'`) per spec v0.4.0 Item 8.
- `tests/Unit/Enums/SessionEndReasonTest.php` (NEW) — 5-case enum coverage; closes pre-existing test gap.
- `tests/Contract/Enums/SessionEndReasonContractTest.php` (NEW) — pins cardinality, PascalCase wire format, legacy-values-first ordering, and explicit absence of deferred values (`Remote`, `EnergyLimitReached`).
- `tests/Unit/SchemaPathTest.php` — extended with `provisioning_schema_exists_at_top_level()`.
- `brianium/paratest` to require-dev — enables `paratest -p 28` parallel test execution.

### Changed
- `README.md` shipped-schema count `77 → 78`; total test count `646 → 656`; per-suite Unit `457 → 466` and Contract `148 → 153`; CriticalMessageRegistry blurb `19 → 20 actions` (catches up v0.3.2's SessionEnded addition).

### Verified (no changes required)
- `Ospp\Protocol\Crypto\CanonicalJsonSerializer` — already implements OSPP Canonical Form per spec v0.4.0 §4.8 (recursive `ksort($data, SORT_STRING)` + `array_is_list()` preservation + `JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES | JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE`). Spec Item 4 is consolidation of pre-existing informal text — no behavior change required.
- `Ospp\Protocol\Crypto\CriticalMessageRegistry` — `SessionEnded` already registered (added in v0.3.2 from spec v0.2.4); new reason values do not introduce new registry entries; `finalSeqNo` discard rule is server-side behavior.
- `Ospp\Protocol\StateMachines\SessionTransitions` — spec Item 8 reuses existing terminal states (`Active → Completed` for `Local`/`LocalOutOfCredit`, `Active → Failed` for `Deauthorized`) with `reason` as discriminator. No new FSM states.

### Migration

This release requires **coordinated v0.3.x → v0.4.0 stack upgrade**:

- **SessionEndReason vocabulary (Item 8):** v0.3.x servers will reject SessionEnded payloads carrying `Local`, `LocalOutOfCredit`, or `Deauthorized` via JSON-schema validation. Stations using SDK v0.4.0 in v0.3.x server fleets MUST be configured to emit only legacy reasons (`TimerExpired`, `Fault`) until the server fleet is upgraded.

Additive changes (Item 3 `seqNo`/`finalSeqNo`, provisioning schema backport) are backwards-compatible — all new schema fields are OPTIONAL; v0.3.x servers ignore unknown fields per spec `02-transport.md §10.1` forward-compatibility rule.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- Add `SessionEnded` to `CriticalMessageRegistry::CRITICAL_ACTIONS` — sync with spec v0.2.4: SessionEnded contains `creditsCharged` used directly for online billing at timer expiry, requires HMAC signing in `Critical` mode

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- Sync `schemas/mqtt/boot-notification-response.schema.json` with spec v0.2.1 — add `supportedVersions` array property (required when Rejected with `1007 PROTOCOL_VERSION_MISMATCH`)
- Update default `protocolVersion` from `0.1.0` to `0.2.1` in `ProtocolVersion` value object and `ConfigurationKey` enum
- Update all test assertions from `0.1.0` to `0.2.1`

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-21

### Added
- **SessionEnded** (MSG-040) — action constant, `SessionEndReason` enum (`TimerExpired`, `Fault`), schema
- Updated README for v0.3.0 (30 actions, 646 tests)

---

## [0.2.1] — 2026-03-04

### Added
- Include protocol JSON schemas (`schemas/mqtt/`, `schemas/common/`, `schemas/ble/`) in SDK package

---
